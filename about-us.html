                        Anna Hill Johnstone (April 7, 1913 â€“ October 16, 1992) 
                        was an American costume designer. 
                        Known for her collaborations with directors Elia Kazan, 
                        Sidney Lumet and Frank Perry, she received two Academy Award nominations for her work on The Godfather (1972) and Ragtime (1981).
                        Johnstone's credits include East of Eden (1955), 
                        Baby Doll (1956), David and Lisa (1962), The Group (1966), 
                        The Godfather (1972), The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974), 
                        The Stepford Wives (1975), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), 
                        and Running on Empty (1988). "almost 15 hour days and sleep about the maximum 
                        is around 4 hours", her favourite costume so 
                        far was the one of Teresa from Claymore,[12]
                        the most ambitious costume was Morrigan's, 
                        and the oddest costume request she has got was 
                        "the almost-naked Kasumi from Dead or Alive."[26] 
                        She has been to over 200 American fan
                        conventions between 2008 and 2013,[6] 
                        when she has decided to "take some time 
                        off" later that year.

                      Timothy Walter Burton[a] (born August 25, 1958) is
                      an American film director, producer,
                      writer and artist. He is known for his 
                      gothic fantasy and horror films such as 
                      Beetlejuice (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990), 
                      The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), 
                      Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999), Corpse 
                      Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber 
                      of Fleet Street (2007), and Frankenweenie (2012). Burton also directed the superhero films Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), the sci-fi film Planet of the Apes (2001), the fantasy-drama Big Fish (2003), the musical adventure film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and the fantasy films Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016).
                      Burton has often worked with actors Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham 
                      Carter (his former domestic partner), 
                      three times with actress Winona Ryder, 
                      and composer Danny Elfman (who has composed 
                      scores for all but three of the films Burton 
                      has directed). He wrote and illustrated the 
                      poetry book The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy 
                      & Other Stories, published in 1997 by British 
                      publishing house Faber and Faber, and a 
                      compilation of his drawings, sketches, and 
                      other artwork, entitled The Art of Tim Burton, 
                      was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, 
                      entitled The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things 
                      You Think About in a Bar, containing sketches 
                      made by Burton on napkins at bars and 
                      restaurants he visited, was released in 2015. 
                      His accolades include nominations for two 
                      Academy Awards and three BAFTA Awards, and wins 
                      for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award.
