                <p>Anna Hill Johnstone (April 7, 1913 â€“ October 16, 1992) 
                    was an American costume designer.

                    Sidney Lumet and Frank Perry, she received two Academy Award nominations for her work on The Godfather (1972) and Ragtime (1981).
                    Johnstone's credits include East of Eden (1955), 
                    Baby Doll (1956), David and Lisa (1962), The Group (1966),

                    and Running on Empty (1988). "almost 15 hour days and sleep about the maximum 
                    is around 4 hours", her favourite costume so 
                    far was the one of Teresa from Claymore,[12]
                     the most ambitious costume was Morrigan's, 
                     and the oddest costume request she has got was 
                     "the almost-naked Kasumi from Dead or Alive."[26] 
                     She has been to over 200 American fan
                      conventions between 2008 and 2013,[6] 
                      when she has decided to "take some time 
                      off" later that year.</p>
                      <p>Her early fame came after some of her cosplays were 
                        featured in the showcase book Otacool 2[11] by 
                        Japanese toy and collectible company Kotobukiya.
                        [12] Le then collaborated with Street Fighter 
                        artist Long Vo to create artwork and a comic for
                         Udon Entertainment's book VENT, as well as with 
                         Sideshow Collectibles' sculptor Tim Miller,

                          Jessica Chobot,[19] and other artists and 
                          companies in the USA and Japan.[20] Le is 
                          a part of costume and armor prop-making 
                          group Team Mantium Designs,[20] later 
                          renamed Mantium Industries,[21] and a video 
                          gamer sponsored by Mad Catz.[20] Le has been 
                          writing a column for YouBentMyWookie[22]
                        She is a particular fan of Psylocke 
                        from X-Men,[27][28] of whom she cosplayed 
                        in every version of the character,[29] and of 
                        Morrigan Aensland from Darkstalkers.[4][28][30]
                        [31] In 2013 interviews, Le said she works 
                        Amped Asia in 2010
